*Concluding remarks:* The term "negro*" appears in this corpus only 38 times, which I found interesting for a corpus of texts spanning the 18th-19th centuries. Predictably, most of the time Black Africans are mentioned, this is in reference to labor, trade and violent reprisals for alleged wrongdoing.
