# Reflections - Part 3 #


**Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not.**

In his blog post *Big Data for Dead People: Digital Readings and the Conundrums of Positivism*, Tim Hitchcock demonstrates what combining a close and distance reading of material involving the life and trial of Sarah Durrant within the same historical argument. 

Reading his intellectual argument about what Durrant's life might have been during and around the time she was convicted of a crime was an enlightening process. 

He begins his argument with a photograph of Sarah Durrant for which he self-admittedly does not have the critical skills to analyze any further but which nonetheless intrigues enough to want to know further. 

Hitchcock defends his choice in saying: 


> She is not important. Her experience does not change anything, but she does provide a slightly different starting point from all the rich dead white men.

From there, he combines both close readings of Durrant's trial with a distant reading of her trial within the context of other criminal trials of that period.   

I found it particularly enlightening that when close reading is combined to distant reading, we can understand macro processes more intimately while at the same time bringing valuable context the close reading of a text. For example,  contextualizing Durrant's trial during a period that saw the rise of 'plea bargaining' explains why a whole "slew of trials that were reported in just a few words". This gives the historian information on how they might do a close reading of Durrant's trial in particular. Perhaps it gives the historian the clue that not everything that transpired was recorded through official channels.     

**What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history?**

The white paper *Digital History and Argument* gives a few tips as to what digital historians ought to do to make their historical argumentation more accessible and robust which I take to be what is currently missing or lacking in current digital historical argumentation. 

A few things:


- Digital collections lack a citation practice for their project and its material. This can be amended by providing a “how to cite” line that enables citation.




- Digital historians do not engage enough with archivists making what they know about the provenance and organization of archives and collections they use opaque. Correspondingly, "citations should be included to finding aids and other discovery tools, and metadata derived from archival descriptions needs to be identified". 



- In the case of digital public history projects, historians can "facilitate engagement with their arguments by incorporating bibliographies that show the historiography underlying their narratives".

- It is also increasingly important for historians to include a more thorough description of methodology within their projects.


Taken together, it seems that what is missing from  historical argumentation in digital history is the details that would make the study reproducible. This means making more explicit the primary sources used and how they came to be selected as well as the methodology and its justification. I think this suggests, among other things, that history as a field has reached a certain diversity that makes in untenable to assume that the historiographic process is the same across the discipline. 


**What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes?** 

For me, as I am not a student in history my engagement with historical methods has been fairly limited. Historical research projects, in my case, has always relied on secondary data as my classes were less about method and original research and more about understanding historical events, processes or contexts. 


**How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it?** 

To me, digital work makes historical research more accessible. I'm amazed by the sheer amount of primary sources that have been digitized. This means that historical scholarship is less restricted to geographical constraints. It also poses a challenge because such breadth of information means certain decisions have to be made in regard to what is relevant for analysis.


**How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?** 

I've come to understand that so much goes into digital historical scholarship.

I think that for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user there should be multiple ways with which the argument is relayed. I have found that visual material is particularly enticing whether in the form of graphs, maps, images, etc. I am further intrigued by the possibility of modes of display that incorporate touch and hearing. 

Further, the reader/viewer/user needs to have an understanding of how the primary data is collected, selected, maintained and generally engaged with. As a political science student, I am fascinated by the politics of the archive: who manages it? What is "archive-able" and how? Who appears / disappears through 'our' archival practices? What ways of knowing/seeing/feeling are foreclosed by these archival practices? 

I think it is just as important for the reader/viewer/user to get a sense of what does not appear as it is to understand what does appear.
